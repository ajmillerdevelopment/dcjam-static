They scored many Indie Chart hits in the Eighties, and are unbelievably still together, and still making great music, with the same line-up &#8211; Keith &#8216;Monkey&#8217; Warren, vocals; Mel Ellis, bass; Pete Dee Davison, guitar; and Michael &#8216;Kid Dee&#8217; Davison, drums &#8211; to this day. Newer members are John Scruff Ellis (Mel&#8217;s brother) guitar &amp; Dan Gratziani on violin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think we all started for different reasons,&#8221; recalls Monkey, of their distant origins. &#8220;Pete and Kid moved to Ipswich from Sunderland were already playing on their own, using pillows for drums in the front room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Adicts became known for their distinctive Clockwork Orange &#8216;Droog&#8217; image, which, along with their urgent, uptempo music and light-hearted lyrics, helped set them very much apart from the rest of the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our message, such as it is, has always been, have fun,&#8221; he continues, attempting to define the secret of their longevity. &#8220;That&#8217;s timeless and appeals to everyone.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the_adicts470x400-e1617295629559.jpg","alt":"The Adicts"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
