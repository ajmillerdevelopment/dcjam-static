While others in the early English punk scene took a heavy heart singing about politics, society and angst, The Adicts separated themselves with their dystopian style and upbeat music with lighthearted lyrics that jabbed with sarcasm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2012 and the only thing that&#8217;s changed is the world around them. On September 11, The Adicts will release their tenth studio album, one that is sure to surprise and please fans. For their latest release, the band stepped out on the ledge, integrating new styles and influences in their music, while maintaining their signature sound.&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp;<strong><em>Review from Artist Direct</em></strong></p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ADICTS-THE-final-cover-PROMO-125.jpg","alt":"all the young droogs"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
