Culminating in a weird mutant sound through rapid juxtapositions of rock, metal, punk, funk and experimental sounds, DOWNTOWN BROWN have forged a diverse sound that is as fully developed as well as it is broadly enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having hypnotized thousands throughout the Midwest with their outright stupidity and nostalgic 80’s-cheese-arena-rock live show, DTB have given new meaning to the term “laser-charged turbo fury.” An omnipresent, high-drawing act in their hometown of Detroit—but still humble!—DOWNTOWN BROWN have long pursued a grassroots mission to unite the eccentrics of the world by creating an environment where “no man shall feel stupid for wearing a giant foam cowboy hat.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The quest has hammered on since 2001, with numerous independent albums along the way – all of which have garnered strong reviews from both international and local publications, most notably METAL MANIACS and PIT MAGAZINE. &#8211; Last.fm</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2012-DTB-2001-2011.jpg","alt":"downtown brown"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
