With&nbsp;a blistering combination of punk and funk, they&nbsp;demolished genre walls and challenged the racial&nbsp;stereotypes and political order of the music&nbsp;industry and the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formed in 1979 in South Central Los Angeles,&nbsp;Fishbone landed a major label record deal soon&nbsp;after the members graduated from high school.&nbsp;However, after this early success the band&nbsp;struggled for acceptance in a racially stratified&nbsp;music industry while their unabashedly hybrid&nbsp;style kept them proudly out of fashion. When the&nbsp;group emerged in the 80s, America s melting pot&nbsp;was being stirred by a mosh pit of disenfranchised&nbsp;youth confronted with lingering racial and economic&nbsp;issues left unresolved by previous generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the band members are increasingly&nbsp;recognized as pioneers, and younger musicians&nbsp;often cite them as big influences in creating new&nbsp;musical possibilities in a blooming multicultural&nbsp;world. As Gwen Stefani of No Doubt remembers,&nbsp;Fishbone was the band that gave us the inspiration&nbsp;to be a band. They are just so unique and that is&nbsp;what I love &#8230; that they were super underground.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2011-10-11-FISHBONE-Crazy-Glue.jpg","alt":"Fishbone Video"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
