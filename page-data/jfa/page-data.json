The band was pivotal in the development of the skate punk and Skate Rock scenes. Over the years, the lineup has included many bass players and drummers but the core of Brannon and Pendleton has remained constant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They began playing together after a D.O.A. concert during the band&#8217;s Hardcore 81 tour. The band&#8217;s name is a reference to John Hinckley, Jr.&#8217;s, attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. Jodie Foster&#8217;s Army was a song before the band took the title as their name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008, JFA signed with DC-Jam Records for the live release of &#8220;To All Our Friends&#8221;, and have since returned to the studio for another new record titled &#8220;Speed of Sound&#8221; which is available for purchase now in CD &amp; digital download . It was the bands first studio recordings in over 12 years. Be sure to check out their new video premiers on BlankTV.com and Youtube.com for their songs &#8220;Wilson&#8221; and &#8220;Danny Sargent&#8217;s Trucks&#8221;.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/JFA+470x400-e1617295841771.jpg","alt":"JFA"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
