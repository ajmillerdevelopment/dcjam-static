This one traverses a musical cesspool that includes dissonant ambience, doo-wop, latin rhythms,and compelling inducements to pull snot out of your own face. Sure to satisfy even the most discriminating party-goer or hipster douchebag. Limited CD pressing, so get it while it lasts.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/front_cover.jpg","alt":"frontal klugman","buylinks":[{"site":"CD","url":"http://interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=210822&"},{"site":"iTunes","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/full-frontal-klugman/id634222279"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
