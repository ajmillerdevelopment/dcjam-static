Toledo based Fast Piece of Furniture formed in 2005 around singer and guitarist Tony Lowe, who had played with a variety of bands in Ohio for years, including Junior Electric. In 2004, Jeff Nelson (co-founder of Dischord Records and former drummer of Minor Threat) visited Toledo. While looking at houses there with a realtor, he heard music coming from the park across the street. Minutes later, he struck up a conversation with the guitarist. Tony later gave him a demo of his band, and jaded as Jeff was, he could not stop listening to it.
