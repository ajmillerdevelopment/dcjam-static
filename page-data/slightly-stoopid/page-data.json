But on August 14, 2012, the Ocean Beach, California-based group—led by co-founders and multi-instrumentalists Miles Doughty and Kyle McDonald—will drop their latest studio effort, Top of the World. As heard throughout the disc, the layoff between albums has not affected the group’s penchant for cooking up the tasty fusion and massive groove that permeates Stoopid’s trademark sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re a touring act, and we’ve been on the road pretty much non-stop over the last decade,” explains Doughty. “It really came into play on the release of the new record. Slightly Stoopid recently released a split LP with Fishbone through DC Jam Records. “Angelo Moore to me is one of the greatest frontmen to ever step foot on a stage. As a fan and out of respect, I try to do something with Angelo every time we have a record, really. If you listen to his lyrics, his vocal performance—I don’t know who could keep up with Angelo on stage,“ says Miles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly two decades into their ongoing metamorphosis, Slightly Stoopid continues to progress into new musical territory, defining their signature sound even further and creating a contagious feel-good vibe. An entire subculture has grown around the social statements the band makes with their music—and it’s been done entirely on their own terms. No wonder they feel like they’re on Top of the World.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SlightlyStoopidSkull_Ticketing470x400-e1617295659104.jpg","alt":"Slightly Stoopid"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
