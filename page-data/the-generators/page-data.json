Frequenting all the early Punk clubs like The Vex, The Cathay De Grande, and Godzilla’s, a then 16 year old Dagger joined in on the action, and started singing for his first punk band Doug &amp;The Slugz. In 1983 The Slugz were documented as one of America’s first OI! Street punk bands, and on any typical night they were opening up for other notorious punk acts like The Abandoned, Ill Repute, Mad Parade, and the Flower Leopards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1989 Dagger would go on to lead the Southern California punk band Schleprock. Through out the nineties the band supported the likes of Green Day, Rancid, The Specials, Sublime, as well as many others. After numerous records and non-stop touring over three continents, Warner Brothers Records eventually swept up Schleprock into the major label record feeding frenzy. In 1996 Schelprock released” Americas Dirty Little Secret”, but due to internal breakdowns and drug addictions Schleprock dis- banded in January of 1997.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along side Dagger, there is also founding member guitarist Mike Snow. Snow and Dagger’s friendship go all the way back to 1980 as child hood friends. Snow was one of the early faces upon the Los Angeles mod scene in the early 1980’s, and his first band Subway also played along side Doug &amp; The Slugz on some of these early LA punk gigs. Mike Snow was also part of one of California’s first street punk bands The Choice through out the mid to late nineties. The Generators prepare to embark on another journey, and another mission to the manipulate the sound waves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2013 The Generators have been in the trenches for 16 years, which in the world of punk rock can be considered a lifetime. They have released 8 full-length albums, and they have put in their fare share of blood, sweat, and tears at earning a name for themselves. There is now a sense that the band has begun to really pay their dues, and is graduating to headlining tours and high profiled albums. The Generators somehow always remain to set themselves apart from the typical punk rock pack. Whether it is with their creative story telling approach, or the way they twist, and turn all the melodies around. The boys from the city of angels somehow always manage to keep changing things up, while keeping their fans feeling safe in that familiar place.</p>\n","image":"https://dcjamrecords.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Generators-PromoImage-470x400-e1617295535162.jpg","alt":"The Generators","fields":{"website":"https://www.the-generators.com/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Generatorsmusic","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6kqxi34Br8uzuKUQ8KVOyw?si=2TB_x62XT_mjvuo6zqU3jg&dl_branch=1","soundcloud":null,"myspace":null,"lastfm":"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Generators","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/thegenerators/?hl=en","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Generators/100050652992079/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
